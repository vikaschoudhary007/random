                Here at Random Defi, we believe that building a strong community
                is the key to success with any DeFi project. We’ve spent
                considerable amounts of time researching what communities in
                this space value.

              <div class="f16-600 text-white pb-3">
                One thing that surfaced over and over again was marketing.
                Community members such as yourself want to know how a team plans
                to grow their user base over time.
              </div>
              <div class="f16-600 text-white pb-3">
                So we’ve decided to make marketing a focal point of our
                community engagement. To accomplish this, we will be allocating
                $100,000 USD to help spread the word about Random. That’s a lot
                of marketing!
              </div>
              <div class="f16-600 text-white pb-3">
                And the best part is: You, the community, will decide how this
                money is spent!
              </div>
              <div class="f16-600 text-white pb-3">
                Following the completion of our IDO, we will hold a community
                round table, where we will listen to your ideas on how best to
                spend our marketing budget.
              </div>
              <div class="f16-600 text-white">
                We will then conduct a poll in our Telegram chat each week,
                where the community will vote on how best to market the project.
                Now that's what I call community engagement!

                  Each week the contract will emit 1.2% of the starting supply
                  to be used as staking rewards. Like we mentioned above, this
                  is expected to be more than offset by the burn function.
                </div>
                <div class="f16-600 text-blue">
                  5% of the 1.2% will be set aside for future use cases that
                  will be decided by the community in a similar fashion to the
                  marketing. This could be put towards marketing or further
                  staking rewards or whatever other crazy ideas our holders come
                  up with!
